# How to use

## Install the effekseer plugin

Download the latest pre-built plugin from [here](https://github.com/effekseer/EffekseerForGodot3/releases).

Copy the addons directory in the zip into your Godot project.

![](../img/Godot_addons.png)

Enable **Status** for **Effekseer for Godot** on the **Plugins** tab of **Project Settings**.

![](../img/Godot_plugins.png)

This completes the plugin installation.

## Resources

Copy your effect files (*.efkefc), textures, sounds, materials, etc. into the `res://` of your Godot project.

![](../img/Godot_resources.png)

### Import effects
The *.efkefc file is imported as a Godot resource.

![](../img/Godot_import_efkefc_success.png)

If successful, subresources such as textures, models and materials will be linked as shown above.

![](../img/Godot_import_efkefc_fail.png)

If the subresource is not linked, try re-importing.

#### scale setting
Sometimes the size of the loaded effect is small and you want to adjust the size. In that case, select the efkefc file, change the `scale` parameter on the Import tab and press the` Reimport` button.

You can change the size of the effect by changing the Scale of `EffekseerEmitter`, but this method may not be magnified depending on the effect settings.

## How to use in 3D scenes
Use an emitter (`EffekseerEmitter`) to emit the imported effect in a 3D scene. Emitters are the source of effects and are used by placing them in a 3D scene.

To play the imported effect file, add `Node` with` EffekseerEmitter` attached to the node tree.

First, add a `Node` with the` EffekseerEmitter` attached to the node tree. (Since it is 3D, it is `EffekseerEmitter` under `Spatial`)

![](../img/Godot_add_node_3d.png)

`EffekseerEmitter` has been added.

![](../img/Godot_emitter_nodetree.png)

Then drag and drop the imported effect into the `Effect` property to specify it.

![](../img/Godot_emitter_scene.png)

Since `Autoplay` is checked, the effect will be displayed when you run the scene.

### Emitter's inspector

![](../img/Godot_emitter_inspector.png)

| Property | Description                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Effect   | Sets the effect resource to play on the emitter |
| Autoplay | If checked, the effect will be played automatically at the start of the scene (`_ready ()` timing) |
| Paused   | Set the pause state during playback |
| Speed    | Set the playback speed of the effect |
| Color    | Set the color of the effect |

## How to use in 2D scenes
Use an emitter (`EffekseerEmitter2D`) to emit the imported effect in a 2D scene. Emitters are the source of effects and are used by placing them in a 2D scene.

To play the imported effect file, add `Node` with` EffekseerEmitter2D` attached to the node tree.

First, add a `Node` with the` EffekseerEmitter2D` attached to the node tree. (Since it is 3D, it is `EffekseerEmitter2D` under `Node2D`)

![](../img/Godot_add_node_2d.png)

`EffekseerEmitter2D` has been added.

![](../img/Godot_emitter2d_nodetree.png)

Then drag and drop the imported effect into the `Effect` property to specify it.

![](../img/Godot_emitter2d_scene.png)

Since the coordinate base of the 2D scene is pixels, specify the scale of `Transform2D`.

![](../img/Godot_emitter2d_scale.png)

Since `Autoplay` is checked, the effect will be displayed when you run the scene.

![](../img/Godot_emitter2d_play1.png)

If the effect looks different than you expected, adjust `orientation`.
For `orientation`, you can specify the angle of rotation for each XYZ axes.

![](../img/Godot_emitter2d_orientation.png)

The effect was displayed in the correct orientation.

![](../img/Godot_emitter2d_play2.png)

### Emitter2D's inspector

| Property  | Description                                         |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Effect   | Sets the effect resource to play on the emitter |
| Autoplay | If checked, the effect will be played automatically at the start of the scene (`_ready ()` timing) |
| Paused   | Set the pause state during playback |
| Speed    | Set the playback speed of the effect |
| Color    | Set the color of the effect |
| Orientation | Set the 3D orientation of the effect |

## Project settings

You can configure Effekseer's overall settings from Godot's project settings.

![](../img/Godot_project_settings.png)

| Property           | Description            |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Instance Max Count | Maximum number of instances generated by a node at the same time |
| Square Max Count   | Maximum number of rectangles used for drawing at the same time |
| Draw Max Count     | Maximum number of draw calls at the same time |
| Sound Script       | Script used for sound playback. Can be replaced |

## Previewing an effect

When you select an efkefc file imported into Godot, you can preview and play it on the Inspector.

![](../img/Godot_effect_previewer.png)

And press "Open in Effekseer" to open the efkefc file in Effekseer.

To use this feature, you need to set the path to the Effekseer tool in the Effekseer section of the editor settings.
